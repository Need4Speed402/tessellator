    //this is a tutorial on tessllator vectors.
    //there are different types of vectors. These are:
    //Tessellator.float()
    //Tessellator.vec2()
    //Tessellator.vec3()
    //Tessellator.vec4()
    
    //as you may guess, Tessellator.float() stores a single float value
    //the vectors though, you may notice a pattern with how they are called.
    //the name starts with 'vec' and ends with a number. This number is the amount of dimentions the
    //vector can store. In other words, the amount of float values the vector can store.
    
    //a vec2 can store 2 float values.
    //there are multiple ways of initializing a vector. The constructor is very linient
    //Tessellator.vec2() = [0, 0]
    //Tessellator.vec2(1) = [1, 1]
    //Tessellator.vec2(15) = [15, 15]
    //Tessellator.vec2(6, 8) = [6, 8]
    //Tessellator.vec2(7, Tessellator.float(9)) = [7, 9]
    
    //with heigher dimentional vectors, more interesting things can happen.
    //Tessellator.vec3(Tessellator.vec2(0, 4), 5) = [0, 4, 5]
    //i used a vec2 in the vec3 constructor. As long as the values passed to the vector all add up to the vector size, it
    //is going to be happy.
    var vec = Tessellator.vec2();
    
    //vectors can have their values acessed exactly like a array, because it is a array. Seriously.
    vec[0] = 10;
    vec[1] = 100;
    
    console.log(vec.toString()) //this is going to give us [10, 100]
    
    //when I said i was serious about these things being arrays, i was not kidding.
    //WebGLRenderingContext.uniform3f(Tessellator.vec3(5));
    //this will work - crazy.
    //this is no trickery, it is not a 'array-like object' this is real.
    
    //So how did I make this work? - simple. I made a standard Float32Array and replaced it's __proto__ object.
    
    //vectors have a lot of math functions in them
    //you can add two vertors together easy.
    
    vec.add(Tessellator.vec2(50));
    
    console.log(vec.toString()); // you will get [60, 150]
    
    //like constructing vectors, these are often very linient.
    vec.add(50); //this will work just as well.
    
    console.log(vec.toString()); // you will now get [90, 200]
    
    //there are a lot more of these functions. Like the basic ones (subtract, divide, abs) and some 3d vector math like cross products
    //on 3d vectors. E.G., var crossProduct = Tessellator.vec3(0, 1, 0).cross(Tessellator.vec3(1, 0, 0)); this will return Tessellator.vec3(0, 0, 1);
    
    //if you want to look at all the functions avaliable and how it works, go to the src code. /src/util/math/* for all math related
    //classes including vectors
    
    //now on to something called swizzleing. This is a very common practice when writing shaders.
    //vectors in Tessellator support swizzleing to some extent.
    
    //with any vector, each has from 1 - 4 elements. so that means that it has x, y, z, and w for a 4 element vector.
    //we are working with a 2d vector so it just has x and y. Lets try setting these properties.
    
    vec.x = 7;
    vec.y = -4;
    
    //we should get vec2(7, -4);
    console.log(vec.toString());
    
    //you can even use the '++' and '+=' operators and the similar
    vec.x++;
    vec.y -= -4;
    
    //we sould now get vec2(8, 0)
    console.log(vec.toString())
    
    //and lastly you can get just lone values like x (we sould get 8)
    console.log(vec.x)
    
    //now wrap your head around this!
    //you can use multiple members and combine them.
    
    //using vec.xy will set the entire vector to 2.
    vec.xy = 2;
    
    //side note: all of these are identical
    vec.xy = 2;
    vec.xy = Tessellator.vec2(2);
    vec.xy = [2, 2];
    vec.xy = {'0': 2, '1': 2, length: 2}
    
    
    vec.xy = [4, 9];
    //you can combine these in different ways.
    console.log(vec.yx.toString()); //you sould get vec2(9, 4)
    //one thing to keep in mind is that if you combine multiple members, you will get a vector to match that.
    //otherwise, if you just ask for a single member you will get a standard javascipt number (I was contimplating useing Tessellator.float())
    
    //you can even create bigger vectors from a smaller one.
    console.log(vec.xyxy.toString());
    console.log(Tessellator.vec3(5, 6, 7).xyyz.toString());
    console.log(Tessellator.float(3).xxxx);
    //these will return a vec4
    
    console.log(vec);
    
    var vec = Tessellator.vec4(1, 2, 3, 4);
    
    //lets work with some more exiting vectors.
    
    //the vectors all support swizzleing and all the combinations too. (I used an algorithm to generate all the swizzle properties)
    
    //this is going to output vec4(1, 2, 4, 3)
    console.log(vec.xywz)
    
    //NOTE:
    //you can use a member multiple times
    console.log(vec.xxxx); //this will output vec4(1, 1, 1, 1);
    //and you can get sub-vectors from these numbers.
    console.log(vec.xyz); //this will output vec3(1, 2, 3)
    
    //one concern with swizzleing is that it might be slow.
    //definantly expenetially slower then calling vec[0] or whatever
    
    var time = Date.now();
    var vec2 = Tessellator.vec4();
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
        vec2.add(vec.wzxy);
    }
    
    //honestly, with my intel i7 4770 processor, results are not bad. ranges from 1 - 2ms to compute on average.
    console.log(Date.now() - time);
    console.log(vec2);
