# tessellator

Tessellator is a rendering engine for WebGL. It's goal is to make WebGL less verbose. I am attempting to make
this engine have low level access to the webgl rendering context while still being able to write code similar to
what you would have for THREE.js. I have made this possible by making the tessellator creatd many classes
with similar functions so you can make your own. I have made the 'writing like THREE.js' concept by including a
'standard library' that implements all the classes I have mentiond above.
